- This project was one of my creative ways of thinking.
- The project tries to use frequency of each note in order to play each note at any octave.
- Although I have found out that there is some debugging needed but it can still play any songs.
- For example, if a full note is gonna get played for 100 times, half a note will be 50 and 1/3 will be 33.
- The Jingle bells song is there to experiment although you can play anything with it and have fun!
