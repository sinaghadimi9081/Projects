Objectives:
Solve problem, design solution and implement using C++
Learn how to use basic C++ constructs and manipulate C++ string class
Handle different types of input errors

Description:
Write a menu-driven program named "ExpressionRecorder" that will provide following menu to record user's input expressions:
1. Enter a new expression
2. Show the largest expression
3. Show all expressions
4. Exit
- "Enter a new expression" option will read in one simple expression in the form: <operand1>  <operator> <operand2>
where operand1 and operand2 are integers and operator will be '+', '-', '*', '/', or '%'
Note: % is the modulo operator where it returns the remainder of the division.
It will format and print out the result of the expression.
- "Show the largest expression" option will display the largest expression that has been entered so far
- "Show all expressions" option will print out all entered expressions

Requirements:
1. The program must produce the same expected output as provided.
2. Array or vector or list class is not allowed. This is an assignment using string, stream, stringstream and functions. Simple variables and string concatenation will be sufficient to solve this problem.
3. There should be no global variables. Please use only local variables and parameters instead.
4. You must define and use at least 6 functions including main() in your program
5. Scanf and printf are not allowed (Please use C++ cin and cout and C++ formatting)
6. Handle invalid menu options such as negative or too big or even alphanumeric such as "abc"
7. When there is no expression available, it should display the informational message of "There is no expression."
8. Format and align all the expressions nicely

Sample output of a program run:
