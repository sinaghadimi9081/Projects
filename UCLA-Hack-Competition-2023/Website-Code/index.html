    <p>Hello World, we are CLAW Patrol.</p> 
     <p> We are a team of 6 and each of our team members has a specific set of skills based on emergency services professions. Our mission is to rescue the Bruin engineers that have been trapped within Boelter Hall.</p>
   <p>Over the last 48 hours, we have been tirelessly working to bring to life our ingenious creation: the remarkable <b>CLAWNTLET</b>. This cutting-edge device will serve as an invaluable aid during our daring rescue operation!</p>
   <div style="text-align: center;"> 
    <img src = "images/cost.jpg" width="900" height="auto"/>
    </div>
      <p>Now let's enter Boelter Hall to rescue our Bruin engineers! We can see the conditions of Boelter Hall using the table below which displays real time data straight from the <b>CLAWNTLET</b>.</p>

      <h2>FEATURES</h2>
      <p>In pursuit of this critical task, we carefully selected specific sensors to equip our <b>CLAWNTLET</b>, each chosen for its unique capabilities and contributions to the success of our mission.</p>
      <ul><b><li>State of the Art Sensors</li></b>
      <p>As we navigate through Boelter Hall, several state of the art sensors will gather and display information on an OLED screen placed on the <b>CLAWNTLET</b>. It includes a Gas Detection Module, Ultrasonic Sensor, NeoPixel Ring, and Temperature/Humidity Sensor.</p>
   <div style="text-align: center;"> 
        <img src = "images/newallsensor.jpeg" width="200px" height="auto"/>
        </div>
        <li><b>Gas Detection Module</b>: able to read the potentially harmful gasses in a room and relays the information to the <b>CLAWNTLET</b> for the user to see.</li>
        <li><b>Ultrasonic Sensor</b>: used to calculate the distance in cm between an object and the <b>CLAWNTLET</b> to be displayed on the OLED screen.</li>
        <li><b>NeoPixel Ring</b>: used to warn the user of potentially harmful conditions by lighting up 12 LEDs with specific colors to indicate danger levels.</li>
        <li><b>Temperature/Humidity Sensor</b>: able to read the temperature and humidity in a room and relays the information to the <b>CLAWNTLET</b> for the user to see.</li>
        <br><li><b>OLED Screen</b></li>
      <p>The <b>CLAWNTLET</b> features a state of the art OLED screen that reads the various sensors located on the <b>CLAWNTLET</b> and displays the information for the user to see.</p>

<h3>CODE</h3>
<div style="text-align: center;"> 
<p>Full code can be found on our <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/PawPatrolUCLA/Arduino">GitHub.</a> </p> 
</div>
 <p>We designed our code with the victims in Boelter Hall in mind. Using the various electronics connected to the ESP32, the code is responsible for communicating with the sensors, OLED screen, and even this website. The code is uploaded to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE and is the heart of our <b>CLAWNTLET</b>. </p>
 <ul><b><li>Arduino IDE Debugging</b></li>
        <div style="text-align: center;"> 
            <img src = "images/error.png" width="700px" height="auto"/>
        </div>
<p>Code is uploaded onto the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE and is powered by a mobile power bank.</p>
<p>As with all coding, it took a lot of debugging to get it working. An example of an issue we encountered with the code involved simple mistakes from missing semicolons to bigger ones like calling the wrong library. Debugging the code consists of headscratches and lots of Google Searches.</p>
<p>In the beginning Derek worked on making all the sensors work since implementing them would be the most important task. Meanwhile, Sina worked on CAD designs and came with many working and non-working prototypes. On the second day, Sina started coding the ESP32 to communicate with the website that Chloe and Derek were designing. Later, Sina and Derek switched their roles and Sina took over writing arduino codes and Derek took over website coding. In the end, Derek and Chloe were able to come up with a very nice website and Sina was able to break down each sensor and make a user interface using a two-push button interface  in case one fails. Our arduino code as shown in smaller files, are broken down to many useful functions and makes it easier to write a completely user friendly Main file. </p>   
<ul><b><li>HTML/CSS Coding</b></li> 
<p>Being the first website all three members worked on, it took a lot of time and effort implementing a nice aesthetic and user inferface into the website. (Look at the anchors on top of the page!) As a team, everyone had a hand in the design and are all very proud of our first website!</p>

<h3>ENGINEERING PROBLEMS</h3>
 <p>Like the coding example above, designing the gauntlet was not always easy. We encountered a lot of problems in CAD, coding, circuits, and Arduinos.</p>
 <ul><b><li>Solution</b></li>
      <p> The mindset we adopted to solve most of these problems was making sure each component worked by itself before it was implemented into the gauntlet. This way, each iteration of our design had only one error at a time. Solving the error, we could move on to the next iteration knowing that all previous iterations worked and whatever we were implementing in the current iteration was the issue.</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;"> 
        <img src = "images/prob.jpg" width="600px" height="auto"/>
    </div>
     <p>One example of an engineering problem was the fact that there is only 1 SDA and 1 SCL pin on the ESP32, which caused errors for us because the OLED and Temperature/Humidity Sensor both require it to talk to the ESP32. With the mindset detailed above, we knew that we only needed to solve the SDA and SCL sharing pins. With more research, we found out it was indeed possible to share SDA and SCL between devices and wired the pins to do so on the breadboard.</p>

      <h3>CAD ITERATIONS</h3>
      
        <p>Below is the first prototype of our <b>CLAWNTLET</b>. It is a two piece design that snaps together and would require drilling and glue to attach the necessary components. As a result, we created a second design.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> 
        
  <img src = "images/wrist.gif" width="300" height="auto">
        <img src = "images/hand.gif" width="300" height="auto">
        
    </div>
        <p>Our second design was in the shape of a cone, but also proved fruitless. The problem with the cone was that it was too weak and could not support the components. It was also ugly.</p>
         <div style="text-align: center;"> 
            <img src = "images/cone.png" width="300px" height="auto"/>
        </div>
         
</div>
        <p>We also made a bowling ball with finger holes inside that would shield the hand. This prototype would lead us to our final hand shield.</p>
         <div style="text-align: center;"> 
            <img src = "images/shieldprot.png" width="300px" height="auto"/>
        </div>




         <ul><b><li>Final CAD Design</b></li>
        <p>Our final design took the cylinder within the second design and added a holder for the battery and breadboard to sit in it. It was also a two piece design with a knuckle holder that housed the sensors which was inspired by the bowling ball. In case of an emergency, the design holds two batteries to ensure the <b>CLAWNTLET</b> is never out of commision. It took about 14 hours for both pieces to finish printing using PLA filament. This final design shows the iteration process of CAD in process. We took what worked in previous designs and ommited what didn't. Of course, the <b>CLAWNTLET</b> would not be itself if it did not have a claw! That's why we installed a state of the art claw on the side that doubles as light! In the end, we came out with a design worthy to be called the <b>CLAWNTLET</b>!</p>
